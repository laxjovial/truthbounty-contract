# Emergency Pause Runbook

## Purpose

This runbook defines the authoritative operational procedure for activating, verifying, and monitoring emergency pause states across the TruthBounty protocol. It governs both the multi-level circuit breaker framework (`EmergencyController.sol`) and the scoped V2 module controls (`EmergencyControls.sol`).

---

## Authority & Separation of Powers

The protocol enforces strict separation of powers across distinct administrative roles:

| Role | Authorized Address / Actor | Activation Powers | Lifting Powers | Security Invariants |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EMERGENCY_COUNCIL** | Multi-sig / rapid response key | Levels 1, 2, 3 (or any V2 scope) | **NONE (Cannot lift pause)** | Rapid response only; cannot unilaterally resume operations |
| **DAO_GOVERNANCE** | Governor + Timelock | Levels 1, 2 (or any V2 scope) | **Full lifting authority** | Formal governance consensus required to lift any pause |
| **TIMELOCK_CONTROLLER** | Governance Timelock contract | Level 1 only (HighRisk) | **NONE** | Subject to mandatory `timelockCooldown` (default 1 hour) |
| **RECOVERY_EXECUTOR** | Designated operational role | None (execution only) | Stepwise recovery | Must execute post-lift verification steps (1 → 2 → 3) |

---

## Multi-Level Circuit Breaker Matrix

The protocol supports four tiered operational levels:

### Level 0 — Normal
- **Description:** Full protocol operations.
- **Allowed Operations:** All claims, evidence, verifications, staking, disputes, treasury, and withdrawals.
- **Recovery Status:** `recoveryComplete == true`.

### Level 1 — HighRisk
- **Description:** Halts high-risk protocol mutations when suspect activity, oracle drift, or verification anomalies are detected.
- **Blocked Operations:**
  - `claim_creation`
  - `staking`
  - `verification_submission`
- **Permitted Operations:**
  - Treasury movements and reward distributions
  - Withdrawals
  - All read-only state queries
  - Governance proposals and timelock executions

### Level 2 — Financial
- **Description:** Halts all value transfers and financial movements in addition to Level 1 restrictions when fund drain risk or invariant violation is suspected.
- **Blocked Operations:**
  - All Level 1 blocked operations
  - `reward_distribution`
  - `treasury_transfer`
  - `withdrawal`
- **Permitted Operations:**
  - Read-only queries
  - Governance recovery actions

### Level 3 — Shutdown
- **Description:** Global emergency lockdown.
- **Blocked Operations:**
  - All standard protocol mutations and user actions.
- **Permitted Operations:**
  - `governance_recovery` calls authorized by DAO governance.

## Trigger Procedures

### 1. Emergency Council Rapid Activation (Levels 1–3)

1. Verify the incident nature and select the appropriate pause level.
2. Formulate an immutable on-chain reason and governance tracking reference:
   ```solidity
   emergencyController.activatePause(
       level,              // 1, 2, or 3
       "Reason string",    // e.g. "Oracle discrepancy in verification round"
       proposalRef         // keccak256("INCIDENT-YYYY-MM-DD-001")
   );
   ```
3. For canonical V2 module-scoped emergencies:
   ```solidity
   emergencyControls.pause(scope); // e.g. SCOPE_CLAIMS, SCOPE_TREASURY, or SCOPE_ALL
   ```

### 2. Timelock Controller Activation (Level 1)

1. Timelock initiates `activatePause(LEVEL_HIGH_RISK, reason, proposalRef)`.
2. Must verify that `block.timestamp >= lastTimelockActivation + timelockCooldown`.

---

### A. Multi-Level Controller Verification (`$EMERGENCY_CONTROLLER`)

1. **Verify On-Chain Pause Level:**
   ```bash
   cast call $EMERGENCY_CONTROLLER "getPauseLevel()(uint8)"
   ```
   *Expected:* Returns target level (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Verify Audit Trail Registration:**
   ```bash
   cast call $EMERGENCY_CONTROLLER "getEmergencyHistoryCount()(uint256)"
   ```
   Query the latest record via `getEmergencyHistory(start, count)` to ensure initiator, reason, and proposal reference are immutably logged.

3. **Verify Operation Freezing:**
   Simulate restricted transactions via `eth_call`:
   - High-risk operations must revert with `OperationPaused(operationType, level)`.
   - Financial withdrawals must revert when level ≥ 2.

4. **Confirm Read Integrity:**
   Ensure read calls (e.g. balance queries, claim state, parameter queries) succeed without disruption.

### B. V2 Scoped Emergency Controls Verification (`$EMERGENCY_CONTROLS`)

1. **Verify Target Scope Pause Status:**
   ```bash
   cast call $EMERGENCY_CONTROLS "paused(bytes32)(bool)" $SCOPE
   ```
   *Expected:* Returns `true` for paused scope (or all scopes if `SCOPE_ALL` was paused).

2. **Verify Pause Metadata:**
   ```bash
   cast call $EMERGENCY_CONTROLS "pausedAt(bytes32)(uint256)" $SCOPE
   cast call $EMERGENCY_CONTROLS "pauseCount(bytes32)(uint256)" $SCOPE
   ```

3. **Verify Event Emission:**
   Check event logs for `EmergencyPaused(bytes32 indexed scope, address indexed actor, uint64 timestamp, uint16 version)` confirming actor, timestamp, and version `1`.

4. **Verify Gated Module Mutation Rejection:**
   Verify that calls to modules implementing `IEmergencyControls` checks revert with `V2Errors.ProtocolPaused()`.

## Post-Pause Recovery Handoff

Once the pause is active and state is frozen:
1. Initiate the **Emergency Recovery and Unpause Drill Runbook** (`docs/runbooks/emergency-drills.md`).
2. Convene DAO Governance and Security Council to diagnose root cause.
3. Prepare timelocked configuration repairs or module upgrades before lifting.
# Runbook: Emergency Pause (V2)

Operational procedure for pausing and recovering the protocol using the
canonical V2 emergency surface.

## Who can pause

| Actor | Surface | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| Emergency Council | `EmergencyController.activatePause` | Escalate protocol pause levels 1–3 (rapid response) |
| DAO Governance | `EmergencyController.activatePause` / `liftPause` | Escalate any level; the only authority that can de-escalate |
| Timelock Controller | `EmergencyController.activatePause` | Level 1 only, subject to a cooldown between activations |
| PAUSE_INITIATOR | `EmergencyGatekeeper.pause` | Scoped pause; can never unpause |
| PAUSE_RESOLVER | `EmergencyGatekeeper.pause` / `unpause` | Scoped pause and post-remediation resolution |

Every pause action emits an immutable audit event
(`EmergencyPauseActivated`, `EmergencyPaused`, and companions in
`docs/event-catalogue-v1.md`).

## When pause is allowed

- Scoped pauses (`EmergencyGatekeeper.pause(scope)`) are allowed while the
  protocol-level controller is not escalated beyond the scope's configured
  tolerance (`setScopeMaxPauseLevel`).
- Global escalation via `EmergencyController` contains every scope; at
  level 3 (shutdown) the gatekeeper treats all scopes as paused regardless
  of tolerance.
- If the wired `EmergencyController` is unavailable (unreachable,
  reverts, or returns malformed data), the gatekeeper fails closed: reads
  classify every scope as paused and mutations revert.

## How to verify pause

1. `EmergencyGatekeeper.paused(scope)` — must return `true` for the
   affected scope(s).
2. `EmergencyGatekeeper.locallyPaused(scope)` — `true` means a scoped
   pause record exists (vs. containment by protocol escalation).
3. `EmergencyController.getPauseLevel()` — the protocol-wide level.
4. Attempt a gated mutation against a canary module; it must revert with
   `V2Errors.ProtocolPaused`.

## Recovery procedure

1. **Remediate the incident** off-chain; agree the remediation record.
2. **De-escalate the protocol level**: only `DAO_Governance` may call
   `EmergencyController.liftPause`.
3. **Complete the staged recovery steps** on the `EmergencyController`
   (`completeRecoveryStep` × 3 by the recovery executor).
4. **Resolve scoped pauses**: `PAUSE_RESOLVER` calls
   `EmergencyGatekeeper.unpause(scope)` for each scope. Resolution is
   rejected while the protocol level exceeds the scope's tolerance.
5. **Verify resumption**: `paused(scope)` returns `false` and a canary
   gated mutation succeeds. Escrowed balances must be unchanged across
   the pause window.

Dependency rewiring (`EmergencyGatekeeper.setEmergencyController`) is
timelocked: replacing or removing a wired controller requires waiting
`emergencyRewireDelay` (default 1 hour, bounded [1 hour, 30 days]).
Wiring a controller when none is wired is immediate, because that
direction only ever tightens control.

## Exercise suite

`test/v2/EmergencyPauseRecoveryExercise.t.sol` rehearses this runbook
against the canonical contracts:

| Drill group | What is proven |
|---|---|
| Configuration | Invalid admin/initiator/resolver, delay bounds, hostile dependency surface, scope-tolerance bounds — all fail closed |
| Compromised roles | Unprivileged callers cannot pause/unpause; the initiator can never unpause |
| Selective pause | Pausing one scope freezes it while sibling scopes stay operational; escrow survives |
| Full pause | Protocol levels 1–3 contain scopes per tolerance; shutdown contains everything and blocks resolution |
| Dependency failure | Reverting, short-returndata, and corrupt-returndata dependencies fail closed; recovery requires a healthy dependency |
| Timelock | Rewiring or unwiring the dependency waits the enforced delay; the new authority takes effect immediately after |
| Remediation & resumption | De-escalation, staged resolution, and safe resumption with intact escrow |

Fuzz properties: `test/v2/EmergencyGatekeeperFuzz.t.sol`.
Invariants (pause effectiveness, escalation containment, exact ghost
bookkeeping): `test/v2/EmergencyGatekeeperInvariant.t.sol`.

## What stays available while paused (V2-SC-162)

The authoritative per-operation matrix is `config/pause-matrix.json`
(mirrored in `contracts/v2/libraries/PauseMatrix.sol`). The full
specification is in `docs/v2/emergency-pause-exit-liveness.md`.

- **Scoped pauses and protocol levels 1–2 never block user exits.** The
  exits are `StakeVault.withdraw` of claimable balances,
  `FinalRewardAllocator.claim`, `PullSettlementLedger.withdraw` and
  `withdrawFromRef`, and a claimant's own `Claims.cancelClaim` refund.
  Protective actions (`EvidenceRegistry.pause`, `cancelNonce`, revoking
  a lock mutator) also stay available.
- **Level 3 (SHUTDOWN) freezes value exits.** They resume as soon as DAO
  governance calls `liftPause`. The emergency council cannot lift.
- **Risk-increasing operations fail closed** on their scope: claim
  creation, staking, verification and aggregation, evidence, settlement,
  and governance parameters (`SCOPE_GOVERNANCE`). They also fail closed
  whenever the pause authority is unreachable or misbehaving. Exits do
  **not** depend on the authority being healthy.
- **Before go-live**, register the gatekeeper under `EMERGENCY_CONTROLS`
  in the module registry. Then call `setPauseAuthority(gatekeeper)` once
  on Claims, EvidenceRegistry, and PullSettlementLedger. Wiring is
  write-once: it cannot be used to lift a pause.
- **Verification.** `isScopePaused(scope)` and `exitsFrozen()` on any
  canonical module must match `EmergencyGatekeeper.paused(scope)` and
  whether the level is 3.
