# TruthBounty V2 — Canonical Contract Threat Model

**Scope**: V2-SC-147  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Status**: Draft — awaiting independent maintainer approval  
**Date**: 2026-09-24  
**Covers**: Canonical modular V2 contract suite deployed on Optimism/EVM  

---

## 1. Protocol Summary

TruthBounty is an on-chain truth-bounty and verifier-incentive protocol deployed on Optimism.
Claimants post bounties against factual claims; verifiers stake reputation-weighted tokens to
vote on claim outcomes; a settlement engine distributes rewards. The V2 canonical suite is modular
and UUPS-upgradeable under timelocked governance.

---

## 2. Asset Inventory

| Asset | Location | Value Class |
|---|---|---|
| BOUNTY token | `TruthBountyToken` (ERC-20) | High — fungible protocol token |
| Verifier stake | `VerificationSubmission` stake ledger | High — principal at risk of slashing |
| Challenge bonds | `StakeVault` (`BondLock` ledger) | High — locked collateral |
| Claim bounty rewards | `ClaimRegistry` / `SettlementEngine` | High — pending payout |
| Reputation scores | `ReputationSnapshot` / oracle | Medium — influences stake weight |
| Admin roles | `AccessControl` role mappings | Critical — controls all mutations |
| Upgrade authorization | `UpgradeController` timelock | Critical — controls contract logic |
| Storage layout | Proxy storage slots | Critical — corruption = state loss |
| Fee revenue | `FeeManager` treasury | Medium — accumulated protocol fees |

---

## 3. Actor Inventory

| Actor | Trust Level | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Claimant** | Untrusted | Submit claims, post bounties, call permissionless functions |
| **Verifier** | Untrusted | Submit stakes, cast votes via `VerificationSubmission` |
| **Challenger** | Untrusted | Open disputes by posting challenge bonds |
| **Resolver** (`RESOLVER_ROLE`) | Privileged | Settle claims (timelocked grant) |
| **Admin** (`ADMIN_ROLE`) | Privileged | Configure parameters, grant roles (timelocked for resolver) |
| **Default Admin** (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`) | Privileged | Grant/revoke all roles |
| **Guardian** | Privileged (narrow) | Pause contracts only; no settlement or treasury authority |
| **Round Manager** (`ROUND_MANAGER_ROLE`) | Privileged | Open verification rounds, record participants |
| **Upgrade Controller** | Privileged (timelocked) | Propose and execute UUPS upgrades |
| **Fee Manager** | Internal contract | Route fee deductions; no settlement authority |
| **Off-chain Indexer / Relayer** | Untrusted observer | Read-only; no settlement authority |
| **Governance Token Holder** | Delegated | Vote on proposals; no direct on-chain mutation |

**Key boundaries**:

1. **On-chain vs. off-chain**: Off-chain components (API, indexer, guardian, relayer, frontend) are read-only observers. They may never call settlement, treasury, or admin functions.
2. **Role boundary**: `RESOLVER_ROLE` grants are timelocked via `ResolverRoleTimelock`. No instant privileged grant.
3. **Upgrade boundary**: UUPS `_authorizeUpgrade` is gated by `UpgradeController` timelock (minimum 1 hour, 24 hours for emergency). No deployer or admin can bypass.
4. **Bond custody boundary**: Only `OPERATOR_ROLE` (the DisputeResolution module) can lock/release bonds. No governance, guardian, or treasury role can release an active bond.
5. **Claim immutability boundary**: Once a claim enters `Active` status, its core parameters (bounty amount, currency, deadline) are immutable.

## 5. Attack Trees

### 5.1 — Treasury Drain

```
GOAL: Extract funds from the protocol treasury / reward pool

├── A1. Exploit reentrancy in settlement payout
│   ├── A1.1 Call settle() with malicious ERC-20 that re-enters
│   │   └── CONTROL: SafeERC20 + ReentrancyGuard on all payout paths
│   └── A1.2 ERC-777 / callback token re-entrance
│       └── CONTROL: SafeERC20 transfer (no callback hooks used)
│
├── A2. Double-claim settlement
│   ├── A2.1 Replay same claim settlement twice
│   │   └── CONTROL: Status transitions are monotonic (DRAFT→ACTIVE→SETTLED)
│   └── A2.2 Submit claim with duplicate content hash
│       └── CONTROL: `_canonicalClaimExists` mapping rejects duplicate hashes
│
├── A3. Role escalation to gain RESOLVER_ROLE
│   ├── A3.1 Compromise DEFAULT_ADMIN key, grant RESOLVER_ROLE instantly
│   │   └── CONTROL: ResolverRoleTimelock delays any RESOLVER_ROLE grant
│   └── A3.2 Flash-loan governance to pass upgrade that removes timelock
│       └── CONTROL: Upgrade timelock independent of governance votes;
│                    governor cannot remove its own timelock in one tx
│
└── A4. Upgrade to malicious implementation
    ├── A4.1 Call upgradeToAndCall directly on proxy
    │   └── CONTROL: _authorizeUpgrade requires UpgradeController approval
    └── A4.2 Inject malicious module via governance proposal
        └── CONTROL: Timelocked upgrade + independent review window
```

### 5.2 — Double-Settlement / Claim Replay

```
GOAL: Settle or withdraw rewards for the same claim more than once

├── B1. Concurrent settlement calls race
│   └── CONTROL: ReentrancyGuard + monotonic status check (reverts if not Active)
│
├── B2. Manipulate claim ID assignment
│   └── CONTROL: _nextClaimId is monotonically incremented; no reuse
│
└── B3. Exploit canonical claim hash collision
    └── CONTROL: SHA-256 content hashing; _canonicalClaimExists mapping
```

### 5.3 — Stake Drain / Slashing Bypass

```
GOAL: Withdraw stake without authorization or avoid slashing

├── C1. Direct withdrawal of locked bond from StakeVault
│   └── CONTROL: Only OPERATOR_ROLE (DisputeResolution) can release bonds;
│                no direct depositor withdrawal of active bonds
│
├── C2. Bypass RESOLVER_ROLE timelock to instant-slash
│   └── CONTROL: All slashing paths require RESOLVER_ROLE which is timelocked
│
└── C3. Grief verifiers by spamming dust stakes to inflate round gas
    └── CONTROL: Minimum stake bound enforced at VerificationSubmission entry;
                 pagination on getClaimVerificationsPaginated prevents gas DoS
```

### 5.4 — Verification Manipulation

```
GOAL: Influence claim outcome without legitimate stake or reputation

├── D1. Sybil attack — create many verifier addresses
│   └── PARTIAL CONTROL: Reputation weighting caps low-rep dominance;
│                         min reputation threshold (0.1 × 1e18) enforced
│
├── D2. Oracle manipulation — feed false reputation scores
│   └── CONTROL: Oracle address is admin-controlled; oracle updates are logged;
│                governance timelock applies to oracle replacement
│   ⚠️  RESIDUAL RISK: Off-chain oracle data source integrity is outside
│       the on-chain trust boundary; oracle freshness is not time-gated on-chain.
│
├── D3. Replay a vote from a previous round
│   └── CONTROL: Round ID scoped to each verification record;
│                round parameters are write-once after openRound()
│
└── D4. Open a second OPEN round for the same claim
    └── CONTROL: At most one OPEN round of each type per claim (VRM invariant #2)
```

### 5.5 — Governance Hijack

```
GOAL: Take permanent control of the protocol

├── E1. Acquire governance token majority, pass malicious proposal
│   └── CONTROL: Upgrade timelock (1 hour minimum) separates vote from execution;
│                independent maintainer review required before execution
│
├── E2. Frontrun upgrade execution with a malicious calldata injection
│   └── CONTROL: Upgrade payload is committed at proposal time and hash-locked
│
└── E3. Admin key compromise — grant unlimited roles
    └── CONTROL: DEFAULT_ADMIN is recommended to be a multisig or timelock;
                 RESOLVER_ROLE grant is independently timelocked regardless
    ⚠️  RESIDUAL RISK: If DEFAULT_ADMIN is a single EOA, key compromise = full control.
                       Mitigation: deploy with multisig admin (documented in deployment spec).
```

## 6. Abuse Cases

| ID | Actor | Abuse Case | Current Control |
|---|---|---|---|
| AB-01 | Claimant | Submit claim with bounty 0 (dust claim) | `assetMinBounty` per asset enforced by `ClaimRegistry` |
| AB-02 | Verifier | Submit stake of 0 after round opens | Minimum stake enforced by `VerificationSubmission` |
| AB-03 | Challenger | Open duplicate disputes to lock bond budget | `_disputesByClaim` mapping enforces exactly one dispute per claim |
| AB-04 | Admin | Set `slashPercentage` to 100% to drain all verifier stakes | Percentage capped at 100 but no lower bound documented; ⚠️ residual risk |
| AB-05 | Off-chain relayer | Replay meta-transactions | EIP-712 nonce per submitter enforced by `_submitterNonce` |
| AB-06 | Verifier | Submit to a closed round | Round status check reverts on non-OPEN round |
| AB-07 | Round Manager | Open unlimited rounds to grief gas | Deadline enforced; closure is permissionless after deadline |
| AB-08 | Governance | Pass emergency pause as prelude to malicious upgrade | Pause and upgrade are independent; pause alone cannot unlock upgrade |
| AB-09 | Indexer | Read stale paginated events and project wrong state | Events are monotonically ordered by block; replay is deterministic |

---

## 7. Existing Controls

| Control | Implementation Location | Property Enforced |
|---|---|---|
| `ReentrancyGuard` | All payout/stake/bond paths | No re-entrant state manipulation |
| `SafeERC20` | All token transfer sites | No callback/hook exploitation |
| Monotonic claim status | `ClaimRegistry` | No status rollback; no double-settle |
| `_nextClaimId` monotonic counter | `ClaimRegistry` | No claim ID reuse |
| Canonical content hash dedup | `_canonicalClaimExists` | No duplicate claim content |
| `ResolverRoleTimelock` | `TruthBountyToken`, `GovernanceOwnable` | Delayed RESOLVER_ROLE grants |
| UUPS `_authorizeUpgrade` | All UUPS contracts + `UpgradeController` | Timelocked upgrade execution |
| `StakeVault` bond custody | `StakeVault`, `OPERATOR_ROLE` restriction | No direct bond withdrawal |
| `AccessControl` role gating | All privileged entrypoints | Least-privilege enforcement |
| Pausable | All settlement/staking paths | Emergency halt without upgrade |
| Round write-once parameters | `VerificationRoundManager` | No post-open round manipulation |
| At-most-one-open-round invariant | `VerificationRoundManager` | No round spam per claim |
| Reputation bounds | `WeightedStaking` (min 0.1, max 10×) | Sybil stake dominance limited |
| EIP-712 nonce | `ClaimRegistry._submitterNonce` | Meta-tx replay prevention |
| Storage layout guard | `StorageCompatibilityValidator` script | No upgrade storage corruption |
| Paginated getters | `VerificationSubmission`, `VerificationRoundManager` | Gas-bounded read paths |
| `MAX_DEADLINE_HORIZON` | `ClaimRegistry` (365 days) | No unbounded claim lock-up |
| Statement length bounds | `ClaimRegistry` (10–2000 bytes) | No calldata bloat DoS |

---

## 8. Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Consequence if false |
|---|---|---|
| AS-01 | `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is held by a multisig or governance timelock | Single EOA compromise = full protocol control |
| AS-02 | The reputation oracle data source is honest and fresh | Stale/manipulated scores distort verification outcomes |
| AS-03 | Optimism sequencer does not censor settlement transactions | Griefable by sequencer in edge cases |
| AS-04 | The ERC-20 bounty token is not rebasing or fee-on-transfer | Accounting invariants break with non-standard tokens |
| AS-05 | `RESOLVER_ROLE` is granted only to the canonical settlement contract | Unauthorized settlement if admin grants to a malicious address within the timelock window |
| AS-06 | `OPERATOR_ROLE` in `StakeVault` is granted only to `DisputeResolution` | Bond release to arbitrary recipient if misconfigured |
| AS-07 | All deployed implementations match their audited source hashes | Bytecode mismatch = unknown logic |

---

## 9. Monitoring Signals

| Signal | Source Event | Alert Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Unexpected role grant | `RoleGranted(role, account, sender)` | RESOLVER_ROLE or DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE granted to unknown address |
| Upgrade proposal | `UpgradeProposed(impl, callData, eta)` | Any upgrade proposal |
| Claim status anomaly | `ClaimStatusChanged(id, from, to)` | Non-monotonic status transition |
| Large single payout | `RewardClaimed(claimId, recipient, amount)` | Amount > configurable threshold |
| Oracle replacement | `ReputationOracleUpdated(old, new)` | Any oracle address change |
| Dispute bond locked | `BondLocked(disputeId, amount, locker)` | Bond amount < configured minimum |
| Emergency pause | `Paused(account)` | Any pause event |
| Settlement of paused contract | Any settlement call while `paused` | Should revert — alert if it does not |
| Slashing above 50% | `VerifierSlashed(verifier, slashed, remaining, reason)` | `slashedAmount / (slashedAmount + remaining) > 0.5` |

---

## 10. Residual Risks

| ID | Risk | Severity | Mitigation Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| RR-01 | Off-chain oracle integrity not enforced on-chain | High | Add freshness timestamp validation; oracle multi-source aggregation (V2-SC-future) |
| RR-02 | Single EOA as DEFAULT_ADMIN | Critical | Enforce multisig deployment; add `require(isContract(admin))` check in initializer |
| RR-03 | Reputation min/max bounds are admin-settable without timelock | Medium | Add governance timelock to reputation bound changes |
| RR-04 | Slash percentage lower bound not set (can be 0%) | Low | Add `require(percentage >= MIN_SLASH_PERCENT)` with a documented minimum |
| RR-05 | ERC-777 / callback tokens accepted as bounty assets | Medium | Add explicit allowlist check for supported asset types |
| RR-06 | Optimism L2 sequencer liveness dependency for timely settlement | Low | Document as known L2 risk; monitor sequencer health |
| RR-07 | Canonical content hash uses off-chain CID — IPFS availability not guaranteed | Low | Document as known off-chain dependency; CID is evidence pointer, not proof |

## 11. Protocol Invariants Linked to Tests

Each invariant below is mapped to its corresponding test file.

| Invariant | Contract | Test Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Claim status is monotonically increasing | `ClaimRegistry` | `test/invariant/TruthBountyInvariant.t.sol` |
| Total verifier weight equals sum of individual weights | `WeightedStaking` | `test/fuzz/WeightedStaking.fuzz.sol` |
| No claim may be settled twice | `ClaimRegistry` | `test/TruthBountyClaims.test.ts` |
| Bond balance in StakeVault ≥ sum of all active locks | `StakeVault` | `test/v2/StakeVaultInvariant.t.sol` |
| Exactly one OPEN round per claim type at any time | `VerificationRoundManager` | `test/VerificationRoundManager.test.ts` |
| Round parameters immutable after `openRound` | `VerificationRoundManager` | `test/VerificationRoundManager.test.ts` |
| `_nextClaimId` strictly increases; no reuse | `ClaimRegistry` | `test/invariant/TruthBountyInvariant.t.sol` |
| Reputation score clipped to `[minScore, maxScore]` | `WeightedStaking` | `test/WeightedStaking.test.ts` |
| RESOLVER_ROLE grant always delayed by timelock | `TruthBountyToken` | `test/ResolverRoleTimelock.test.ts` |
| Upgrade only callable through UpgradeController | All UUPS proxies | `test/upgrade/UpgradeController.t.sol` |
| Treasury emission per epoch ≤ configured cap | Tokenomics module | `test/invariant/TokenomicsInvariant.t.sol` |
| Canonical claim hash is globally unique | `ClaimRegistry` | `test/ClaimRegistry.test.ts` |

---

## 12. Module Boundary Summary

| Module | Reads | Writes | Authority Granted |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ClaimRegistry` | Self | Claim storage | `REGISTRY_UPDATER_ROLE` callers |
| `VerificationSubmission` | `ClaimRegistry` | Stake ledger | None (ReentrancyGuard only) |
| `VerificationRoundManager` | Self | Round ledger | `ROUND_MANAGER_ROLE` callers |
| `DisputeResolution` | `ClaimRegistry`, `StakeVault`, `FeeManager` | Claim status, BondLock | `OPERATOR_ROLE` on StakeVault |
| `StakeVault` | Self | Bond ledger | `OPERATOR_ROLE` only (DisputeResolution) |
| `WeightedStaking` | Oracle | None persistent | None |
| `UpgradeController` | All UUPS proxies | Upgrade execution | Governed timelock |
| `FeeManager` | Self | Fee ledger | No settlement authority |
| Off-chain API / Indexer | Events (read-only) | **None** | **None** — hard boundary |

---

## 13. Migration and Compatibility

- **Active claims in-flight at upgrade time**: Claim parameters are immutable; upgrading `ClaimRegistry` cannot alter in-flight claim state. Storage layout is validated by `StorageCompatibilityValidator` before every upgrade execution.
- **Verifier stakes in-flight**: `VerificationSubmission` is not UUPS; it is replaced by pointing the registry at a new address via admin configuration. Existing stake records remain readable at the old address.
- **Event replay guarantee**: All events (claim create, status change, stake deposit, bond lock, round open/close) carry sufficient indexed fields for deterministic off-chain projection replay. No event-only data is discarded on upgrade.
