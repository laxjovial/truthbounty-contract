/**
 * @title TruthBountyGovernor
 * @notice GovernorBravo-compatible OpenZeppelin governor integrated with {TimelockController}.
 * @dev Proposals may only target registered governed modules and are blocked from claim-outcome calls.
 *      Guardian cancellation is separate from timelock execution authority.
 *
 *      Cancellation semantics (V2-SC-066): a proposal may only be cancelled while it is in a
 *      non-terminal state (Pending, Active, Succeeded, or Queued) and only under one of the four
 *      explicit {CancelAuthority} conditions — proposer withdrawal, proposer-below-threshold
 *      invalidation, guardian veto, or governed-module invalidation. Every other path fails closed
 *      with {ProposalCancellationUnauthorized}. Cancellation decisions are evaluated freshly on
 *      every call against canonical state, so no authorisation can be stored, replayed, or reused
 *      after the proposal it was granted for has left the cancelable window.
 *      ## Canonical Snapshot Integration (V2-SC-063)
 *
 *      At proposal creation, `_propose` calls `governanceSnapshot.registerSnapshot(proposalId)`,
 *      recording the exact `block.timestamp` at which the proposal was created as the
 *      canonical voting-power freeze point. This timestamp is identical to
 *      `proposalSnapshot(proposalId)` used by {GovernorVotes._getVotes} and ensures that
 *      voting-power queries cannot be influenced by token transfers, delegations, or
 *      stake changes that occur after proposal creation.
 *
 *      If `governanceSnapshot` is set (non-zero), snapshot registration is mandatory: a
 *      failed call reverts the entire `_propose` call, preventing proposals from existing
 *      without a canonical snapshot entry (fail-closed).
 *      ## Native Value Isolation (V2-SC-153)
 *
 *      TruthBounty V2 accounting is token-denominated, so the governor never holds, forwards,
 *      or accounts for native currency:
 *        - {receive} rejects every native transfer unconditionally, in every executor
 *          configuration and identically for the implementation and any proxy.
 *        - Both {execute} overloads reject an attached `msg.value`, so execution can never be
 *          funded with native currency (which would otherwise be credited to the timelock and
 *          could be disbursed through a proposal's `values`).
 *        - Every proposal operation must carry a zero native value (`values[i] == 0`),
 *          enforced when the proposal is created and again when it executes.
 *
 *      Native currency forced onto this contract or onto the timelock (for example through
 *      SELFDESTRUCT) cannot be prevented at the EVM level, but it is economically inert: no
 *      governance path reads `address(this).balance`, no path transfers it out, and it grants no
 *      voting weight, no proposal threshold credit, and no claimable balance anywhere.
