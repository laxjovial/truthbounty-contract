/// @title EmergencyGuarded
/// @notice Fail-closed emergency-control mixin for canonical V2 modules.
/// @dev A module inherits this contract, calls `_setEmergencyControls` once during wiring, and
///      applies `whenOperationAllowed(<scope>)` to every state-mutating entry point, using a scope
///      constant from `V2Scopes`.
///
///      The guard is deliberately fail closed in two ways:
///
///      - If no control plane is configured, every guarded mutation reverts with
///        `EmergencyControlsNotConfigured`. An unwired module is frozen, never open.
///      - If the configured control plane cannot be reached, or the scope is unknown to it, the
///        call reverts. `EmergencyControls.requireOperationAllowed` rejects unknown scopes, so a
///        typo in a scope constant freezes the module rather than bypassing the control plane.
///
///      The configuration setter is intentionally *not* guarded. Governance must always be able to
///      repair a broken or superseded control-plane reference during a pause; guarding the setter
///      would make a misconfigured pause unrecoverable.
